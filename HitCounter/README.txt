Trying to use Carl Franklin's guidance from 
User Tracking in Blazor Server: Carl Franklin's Blazor Train Ep 72

There is a download link for Carl's sources, which work as expected.

However, that is an older version of Blazor.

For this project I'm using NET9.0
The code is the same as Carl's otherwise. (I did rename CircuitHandlerService to CircuitHandlingService.)

For some reason the CircuitHandler.OnCircuitOpenedAsync() is never called.
